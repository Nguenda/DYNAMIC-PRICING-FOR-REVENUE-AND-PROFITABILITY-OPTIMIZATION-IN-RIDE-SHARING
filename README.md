# DYNAMIC PRICING FOR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY OPTIMIZATION IN RIDE SHARING

## About the Dataset

A ride-sharing company wants to implement a dynamic pricing strategy to optimize fares based on real-time market conditions. The company currently uses only ride duration to decide ride fares. The company aims to leverage data-driven techniques to analyze historical data and develop a predictive model that can dynamically adjust prices in response to changing factors.

The dataset containing historical ride data has been provided. It includes features such as the number of riders, number of drivers, location category, customer loyalty status, number of past rides, average ratings, time of booking, vehicle type, expected ride duration, and historical cost of the rides.

Your goal is to build a dynamic pricing model that incorporates the provided features to predict optimal fares for rides in real time. The model must consider factors such as demand patterns and supply availability. The dataset includes the following features:

- **`Number_of_Riders`**: Number of people requesting the ride.
- **`Number_of_Drivers`**: Number of available drivers at the time.
- **`Location_Category`**: The location where the ride is requested (e.g., urban or suburban).
- **`Customer_Loyalty_Status`**: Whether the customer is a loyal user (could be categorical: Yes/No or 0/1).
- **`Number_of_Past_Rides`**: How many previous rides the customer has taken.
- **`Average_Ratings`**: Ratings given by customers to the driver.
- **`Time_of_Booking`**: The time at which the ride was booked (can be converted to hour, day, week, or part of the day for better analysis).
- **`Vehicle_Type`**: The type of vehicle requested (e.g., sedan, SUV).
- **`Expected_Ride_Duration`**: Estimated time of the ride in minutes.
- **`Historical_Cost_of_Ride`**: The previous fare for a similar ride (dependent variable we want to predict).
